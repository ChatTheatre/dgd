   The platform must meet the following requirements:

 - Shorts should be 2 bytes wide.
 - Integers should be either 2 or 4 bytes wide.
 - Longs should be at least 4 bytes wide.
 - Two's complement should be used to represent negative numbers.
 - The value of NULL must be 0.

   Machine dependent stuff should be restricted to the host.h file and
possibly additional files in the host subdirectory.  At present, I only
have definitions for MINIX_68K (Minix 1.5 for 68000 computers, probably
works for Minix 1.6 as well) and SUN.  Porting to other platforms shouldn't
be too difficult.

   I will port the driver to Mac, PC, Atari ST and Sinclair QL myself.
