 <H2> 1. Introduction </H2>

 <H3> 1.1. Purpose </H3>

This document is a formal description of the LPC programming language.
The LPC programming language is derived from C and named after its primary
creator, Lars Pensjö.  Several dialects of LPC exist; the programming
language described here is the one used in <I>Dworkin's Generic Driver</I>
(DGD) version 1.1.

<!-- I will use the term LPCd to indicate the DGD dialect of LPC in
     particular. -->


 <H3> 1.2. History </H3>

<!-- First came LPmud 1, then LPmud 2, etc.
     Game driver vs. multipurpose server. -->


 <H2> 2. Environment </H2>

<!-- A description of objects, the server and clients.
     Compilation of files to objects.  Translation phases (preprocessor).
     ASCII code used, ISO 8859-1 recommended extension.
     Value of newline etc. is fixed.
     A description of which functions are called by the server, and when. -->


 <H2> 3. Language </H2>

In the syntax notation of this document, syntactic categories are
indicated by <I>italic</I> type.


 <H3> 3.1. Lexical elements </H3>
 <H3> 3.1.1. Tokens </H3>

A <I>token</I> is the minimal lexical element of the language.  The
categories of tokens are:
<I><A HREF="#identifiers">identifiers</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#keywords">keywords</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#constants">constants</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#operators">operators</A></I> and
<I><A HREF="#punctuators">punctuators</A></I>.  Tokens are separated by
white space: blanks, horizontal and vertical tabs, newlines, carriage returns,
form feeds and comments.


 <H3> 3.1.2. Comments </H3>

A comment is a sequence of characters starting with the characters <TT>/*</TT>
and terminated by the characters <TT>*/</TT>, or a sequence of characters that 
starts with // and terminated by a new line.  All characters in between are
part of the comment.  Comments count as whitespace separating tokens, and
may not be nested.  The sequence <TT>/*</TT> does not start a comment if it
is part of a string.
<PRE>
Examples: // This is a comment
	  /* This is another 
                     comment */
</PRE>

 <H3> <A NAME="identifiers"> 3.1.3. Identifiers </A> </H3>

An identifier is an arbitrary long sequence of letters, digits and
underscores.  The first character must be a letter or underscore.  Upper- and
lower-case letters are different.  Only the first 1023 characters of
identifiers are significant.


 <H3> <A NAME="keywords"> 3.1.4. Keywords </A> </H3>

The following identifiers are reserved for use as keywords:

  <PRE>
	atomic      do          int         private     varargs
	break       else        mapping     return      void
	case        float       mixed       rlimits     while
	catch       for         nil         static
	continue    if          nomask      string
	default     inherit     object      switch
  </PRE>


 <H3> <A NAME="constants"> 3.1.5. Constants </A> </H3>

A <I>constant</I> is either an
<I><A HREF="#integer constants">integer constant</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#floating constants">floating constant</A></I>,
<I><A HREF="#string constants">string constant</A></I> or
<I><A HREF="#character constants">character constant</A></I>.


 <H3> <A NAME="integer constants"> 3.1.5.1. Integer Constants </A> </H3>

An <I>integer constant</I> is a <I>decimal constant</I>, <I>octal constant</I>
or <I>hexadecimal constant</I>.
<P>
A sequence of digits is taken to be a <I>decimal constant</I> (base ten)
unless it begins with <TT>0</TT>.  A sequence of digits starting with <TT>0</TT>
and not including <TT>8</TT> or <TT>9</TT> is an <I>octal constant</I>
(base 8).  A sequence of digits and upper- or lower-case letters in range
<TT>A</TT> through <TT>F</TT>, preceded by <TT>0x</TT> or <TT>0X</TT> is a
<I>hexadecimal constant</I> (base 16, where <TT>A</TT> through <TT>F</TT>
have the decimal values 10 through 15).
<P>
<I>Integer constants</I> are represented by 32 bit 2's complement arithmetic,
and range from -2147483648 through 2147483647.  It is an error to specify a
<I>decimal constant</I> that is too large to be represented.  <I>Octal
constants</I> and <I>hexadecimal constants</I>, when too large, are
truncated to the lower 32 bits.
<P>

<!-- For instance, the number forty-seven can be written as 47, 057 or 0x2f.
     There is a problem particular to LPCd with regard to -2147483648.  Since
     LPCd, unlike C, has no unsigned type, the decimal version of this number
     (which is scanned as - 2147483648) is the negation of a number too large
     to be represented.  - and 2147483648 cannot be read as a single token,
     because then 1-2147483648 would be scanned as two consecutive integers.
     This number must be specified by an octal or hexadecimal constant. -->


 <H3> <A NAME="floating constants"> 3.1.5.2. Floating constants </A> </H3>

A <I>floating constant</I> consists of an integer part, a decimal point, a
fraction part, and an exponent part, consisting of an <TT>e</TT> or <TT>E</TT>
and an optionally signed integer exponent.  Either the integer part or the
fraction part, but not both, may be missing.  Either the decimal point and
fraction part, or the exponent part, but not both, may be missing.
<P>
<I>Floating constants</I> represent a floating point number in the range of
-1.79769313485E308 through 1.79769313485E308, the smallest possible number
being -2.22507385851E-308.  It is an error to specify a <I>floating constant</I>
that is too large to be represented.  Numbers which are too small are
flushed to zero.


 <H3> <A NAME="string constants"> 3.1.5.3. String constants </A> </H3>

A <I>string constant</I> is a sequence of zero or more characters enclosed
in double quotes.  All characters, with the exception of newline, can be used in
a <I>string constant</I>.  A backslash character <TT>\</TT> introduces an
escape sequence, which consists of at least 2 and at most 5 characters
(including the backslash), and which is translated into a single character in
the string.  The following escape sequences can be used:

 <PRE>
	\a = 007 (bell)			\o
	\b = 010 (backspace)		\oo
	\f = 014 (form feed)		\ooo
	\n = 012 (newline)		\xh
	\r = 015 (carriage return)	\xhh
	\t = 011 (horizontal tab)	\xhhh
	\v = 013 (vertical tab)		\c
 </PRE>

The value of <TT>\a</TT>, <TT>\b</TT>, <TT>\f</TT>, <TT>\n</TT>, <TT>\r</TT>,
<TT>\t</TT> and <TT>\v</TT> is the octal value shown.  <TT>\o</TT>,
<TT>\oo</TT> and <TT>\ooo</TT> constitute an integer of at most 3 octal
digits, the octal value of which specifies a single character.  <TT>\xh</TT>,
<TT>\xhh</TT> and <TT>\xhhh</TT> constitute an integer of at most 3 hexadecimal
digits, the hexadecimal value of which specifies a single character.  All other
escape sequences <TT>\c</TT> specify the character <TT>c</TT> (any character
except <TT>a</TT>, <TT>b</TT>, <TT>f</TT>, <TT>n</TT>, <TT>r</TT>, <TT>t</TT>,
<TT>v</TT>, <TT>x</TT>, or a digit), which itself is not interpreted in any
special way.

<!-- For example, "\"" is the string constant consisting of a double quote
     character.  "\g\?\0123" is the same as "g?\n3".
     The value of \a .. \v is fixed, and identical on all hosts, even on
     those which have C compilers with different values for them.
     Note that at most three hexadecimal digits can be used, even though all
     characters can be expressed with just two. -->


 <H3> <A NAME="character constants">3.1.5.4. Character constants </A> </H3>

A <I>character constant</I> consists of a single character or escape sequence,
enclosed in single quotes.  All characters except newline can be used.
Escape sequences are handled as with <I><A HREF="#string constants">string
constants</A></I>.

<!-- So-called multiple character constants are not allowed. -->


 <H3> <A NAME="operators"> 3.1.6. Operators </A> </H3>

The following are operators:

 <PRE>
	[   ]   (   )   -&gt;
	++  --  +   -   ~   !   ... catch
	*   /   %   &lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;  &lt;   &gt;   &lt;=  &gt;=  ==  !=  &amp;   ^   |   &amp;&amp;  ||
	?   :
	=   *=  /=  %=  +=  -=  &lt;&lt;= &gt;&gt;= &amp;=  ^=  |=
	,
 </PRE>


 <H3> <A NAME="punctuators"> 3.1.7. Punctuators </A> </H3>
Punctuators are like a '.' in a sentence, there are a variety of punctuators
but they are only used in key places.  For example when your defining a 
variable, you might type: <B>int x, y;</B>.  The ';' is a punctuator that 
says this is the end of this statement.  The ',' says I have another int
that I want to define.  The following are some of the punctuators you will see: 
<PRE>
	, ; :
</PRE>
We'll introduce them as we need them, because they need context to make sense.

 <H3> 3.2. Expressions </H3>

 <H3> 3.3. Constant expressions </H3>

 <H3> 3.4. Declarations </H3>
A <I>Declaration</I> can be a 
<I><A HREF="#varaible declaration">variable declaration</A></I>,  
<I><A HREF="#array declaration">array declaration</A></I>,  
<I><A HREF="#fuction declaration">function declaration</A></I>.

 <H3> <A NAME="variable declaration"> 3.4.1. Variable declaration </A> </H3>
A variable declaration has the following form:
<I><A HREF="#types">TYPE</A></I> Identifier;<BR>
If you have multiple variables of the same time, you can separate them by a
coma to keep them on the same line:  TYPE Identifier1, Identifier2;
<BR>
Examples:
<PRE>
	int x;
	mixed bing;
	float a, b;
</PRE>

 <H3> <A NAME="types"> 3.4.2. Types</A> </H3>

The following types are supported:
<PRE>
	nil, int, float, string, object, mapping, mixed, lwobject, void
</PRE>

 <H3> <A NAME="array declaration"> 3.4.3. Array declaration </A> </H3>

Examples:
<PRE>
	int x[5];
	string *strings;
</PRE>

 <H3> <A NAME="function declaration"> 3.4.4. Function declaration </A> </H3>
A function declaration can be a 
<I><A HREF="#function prototype">function prototype</A></I>, or a 
<I><A HREF="#function definition">function definition</A></I>.
  
 <H3> <A NAME="function prototype"> 3.4.4.1. Function prototype </A> </H3>
A prototype is used to reserve a name for a function, and specify the
number of parameters you need to give it as well as define what the function
will return, without defining the actual function.  It allows the driver
to put the function in the symbol table even though it does not know what the 
function is yet.  It is basically saying "hey I'm going to make a function 
that looks like this later".

A function prototype has the form: TYPE Identifier(PARAMS);

 <H3> <A NAME="function definition"> 3.4.4.2. Function definition </A> </H3>

A function definition has the form: TYPE Identifier(PARAMS) { STATEMENTS }

 <H3> 3.5. Statements </H3>

 <H3> 3.6. Inheritance </H3>

Inheritance is one of the key building blocks of lpc.  The mudlib defines
some standard objects.  For example, maybe your mudlib has: 
/std/object.c, /std/room.c or /std/monster.c.
You can use these building blocks by inheriting them.<BR>
Example:
<PRE>
	inherit "/std/room.c";
	void create( void ) {
		::create();
		set_short("The void");
		set_long("A vast nothingness.");
	}
</PRE>

Because we have inherited our standard room, we get all of the code
in our room file for free.  Because our room code has a function for
set_long, we do not need to define set_long, we can just call it.
This makes programming in lpc much more readable and maintainable.
If we want to we can override our set_long function by defining a new
function with the same name.  In the above example, we have wrote
over the create function.  With a new function that sets a short and
long description for our room.  the :: operator is used to call a function
that is defined at a higher level.  So ::create(); says first call
the create function that was defined before this create function.
So its important to call ::create(); so that we do not have to
duplicate all of the code in /std/room.c's create function.
We can just call ::create(); and then after that make any additional
modifications we want to make.  If we don't care about the previously
defined create function we can remove the ::create(); call.
