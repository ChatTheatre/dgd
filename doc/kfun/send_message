NAME
	send_message - send a message to a user

SYNOPSIS
	int send_message(string message)
	int send_message(int echo)


DESCRIPTION
	In the first form, send a message to the user associated with the
	current object, returning the number of bytes that could be sent
	immediately.  When used by the driver object, the string will be
	written to stderr.  In the second form, user input echoing will be
	turned off or on, depending on the value of the argument being zero or
	non-zero, respectively; the return value is 1 if input echoing could be
	turned on, or 0 otherwise.
	If only part of the string could be sent right away, the remainder of
	the string is buffered, and message_done() will be called in the user
	object when all data in the buffer has been sent.
	If send_message() is used to send a new string before all of the
	buffered data from a previous call has been sent, the buffered data is
	discarded.
