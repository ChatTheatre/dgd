NAME
	compile_object - compile an object

SYNOPSIS
	object compile_object(string file)


DESCRIPTION
	Compile an object from a LPC file, specified by the argument string
	with ".c" appended.  The returned object will have the argument string
	as name.
	If the object to be compiled already exists and is not inherited by
	any other object, it and all of its clones will be upgraded to the
	new version.  Variables will be preserved only if the also exist in
	the new version and have the same type; new variables will be
	initialized to 0.  The actual upgrading is done immediately upon
	completion of the current thread.
