NAME
	parse_string - parse a string

SYNOPSIS
	varargs mixed *parse_string(string grammar, string str,
				    int alternatives)


DESCRIPTION
	Parse a string as described by the grammar.  The format of the
	grammar is described in the document called 'Parsing'.  If parsing
	is successful, the parse tree is returned as an array.  The optional
	third argument specifies the number of alternative parse trees to
	integrate in the result, if the grammar is ambiguous.
	parse_string() uses internal object storage to cache grammars and
	generated automatons, which is not removed until the object is
	destructed.
	This function cannot be used from a user or editor object.
