NAME
	editor - handle an editor command

SYNOPSIS
	void editor(string command)


DESCRIPTION
	Execute an editor command for the current object.  If the editor
	command is the first for this object, an editor instance will be
	created for it.  The editor instance will remain active until an
	editor command is specified that terminates it, or until the object
	is destructed.  Editor output will be sent to the function
	receive_message() in the editor object.  The editor status of an
	object can be queried with the kfun query_editor().
	File paths for reading and writing will be translated by read_ed_path()
	and write_ed_path(), respectively, in the driver object.

ERRORS
	If the editor() command is issued for an object without an active
	editor instance, and the number of editor instances in the system
	is equal to the constant MAX_EDITORS, defined in the include file
	<limits.h>, an error will result.
	It is not possible to start an editor instance for a user object.
