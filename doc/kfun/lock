NAME
	lock - lock code

SYNOPSIS
	type lock(expression)


DESCRIPTION
	Execute the code for <expression>, without execution cost limitations,
	and with some extra space on the function call stack.  The return
	type is the same as the type of <expression>.  lock() can only be used
	by the auto object.
	If catch() is used inside lock(), the execution cost will be reset,
	and the effect of lock() will be cancelled inside the catch().

ERRORS
	It is still possible to force an error inside a locked expression by
	leaving too little space on the value stack.

SEE ALSO
	kfun/catch

NOTE
	lock() is not a real kfun.  lock(a, b) will evaluate the expression
	(a, b), rather than "call lock() with arguments a and b".
