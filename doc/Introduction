   DGD, which stands for Dworkin's Generic Driver, is a mud server that
uses the same overall design as the LP server made by Lars Pensjö.
However, there are several important differences: DGD uses less memory
because it is disk-based; it can dump state and later restart from a
state dump; it uses LPC as an internal interpreted language, but also
offers the option of precompiling LPC objects to C, making them part of
the program itself.
   DGD has two special objects which determine the interface with the 
server for all other objects: the auto object and the driver object.
   The auto object (short for automatically inherited object) is
inherited by all other objects, except for the driver object.  It can
redeclare the predefined functions (called kfuns, kernel functions)
that DGD provides, and it can also define standard properties that
every object should have.  DGD is made in such a way that some kfuns
<have> to be redeclared in an environment with several users
programming together; for instance, by default there is no file security.
The auto object has some other special properties; static functions
declared in the auto object cannot be called using this_object()->func()
(i.e. they behave like kfuns).
   The driver object defines several functions which are called by the
driver, mostly to translate pathnames.
   The following functions will be called by the driver:
 - in the driver object:

    void initialize()

	Called when the system starts up after a reboot.

    void restored()

	Called after the system has restarted from a state dump.

    string path_ed_read(string path)

	Used to translate a path for an editor read command.  If 0 is
	returned, the file cannot be read.

    string path_ed_write(string path)

	Used to translate a path for an editor write command.  If 0 is
	returned, the file cannot be written to.

    string path_object(string path)

	Used to translate a path for call_other(), clone_object() or
	find_object().  If 0 is returned, the object cannot be used.
	This function is only called if call_other(), clone_object()
	or find_object() is not used by the driver object, and not
	used from a function that is defined in the auto object.

    string path_inherit(string file, string path)

	Used to translate inheritance path <path> upon compilation of
	the object with filename <file>.  If 0 is returned, the object
	for <path> cannot be inherited.

    string path_include(string file, string path)

	Used to translate include path <path> upon compilation of the
	object with filename <file>.  If 0 is returned, the file <path>
	cannot be included.

    object compile_object(string file)

	If there is no LPC .c file for an object to be compiled from
	<file>, this function is called; if it returns an object, this
	object will be substituted for the object to be loaded (renaming
	the object).

    void recompile(object obj)

	If an object A is loaded, A inherits B, B inherits C, and the
	version of C inherited by B is out of date, recompile(B) will be
	called in the driver object.  If B should actually be recompiled
	(inheriting the new version of C from B), the driver object must
	destruct B; if this is done, A will inherit the most recent
	versions of B and C.

    object telnet_connect()

	Return an object for a new connection on the telnet port.

    object binary_connect()

	Return an object for a new connection on the binary port.

    void compile_error(string file, int line, string err)

	Handle a compile-time error; there can be several for the same
	LPC file before a runtime error results (calling log_error).

    void runtime_error(string error, int caught)

	Called when a runtime error occurs.  <caught> specifies whether or
	not the error occurred in code run with catch().  runtime_error()
	is called with rlimits (-1; -1) so it will not run out of stack or
	ticks.

    int compile_rlimits(string objname)

	An object uses the rlimits (stackdepth; ticks) { /* code */ }
	construct, which can be used to assign arbitrary limits to function
	call stack depth and ticks; running out of ticks during execution
	causes an error.  -1 signifies an infinite amount of stack space or
	ticks.
	During compilation, driver->compile_rlimits(objname) is called.  If
	non-zero is returned, the object will be able to use rlimits at
	runtime with no restructions.  If 0 is returned,
	driver->runtime_rlimits() will be called at runtime to further
	verify if an object is allowed to change its rlimits (resource
	limits).

    int runtime_rlimits(object obj, int stack, int ticks)

	Called at runtime for rlimits constructs not already cleared by
	compile_rlimits().  If 0 is returned, the rlimits usage is illegal
	and is aborted with an error.
	Values for stack and ticks: < 0 = infinite, 0 = no change,
	> 0 = set to specified amount.

 - in every object:

    void create()

	Called in an object which has just been cloned, or if it is not a
	clone, just before a function is called in it for the first time.
	The actual name of this function is configurable.

 - in the user object (returned by driver->telnet_connect() or
   driver->binary_connect()):

    void open()

	A connection has just been opened for this object.

    void close()

	The connection for this object has just been closed.  close() is
	called when the user goes linkdead, or when the user object is
	destructed.

    void receive_message(string message)

	This function is called with the text the user typed.  For telnet
	connections, this is always an entire line, with the newline at
	the end filtered out.  For binary connections, this is whatever
	the other side of the connection saw fit to send, without any
	filtering or processing.

   On startup, the system is configured with a configuration file, which
must specify the following configuration parameters:

param		type	meaning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
telnet_port	number	The port number on which the driver will accept
			telnet connections.
binary_port	number	The port number on which the driver will accept
			binary connections.  Communication on the binary
			port is raw TCP/IP without additional protocol.
directory	string	The base directory for the system.
users		number	The maximum number of active telnet and binary
			connections.
editors		number	The maximum number of simultaneously active
			editor instances.
ed_tmpfile	string	The proto editor temporary file (actual files
			will have a number appended).
swap_file	string	The name of the swap file.
swap_size	number	The total number of sectors in the swap file.
cache_size	number	The number of sectors in the swap cache in memory.
sector_size	number	The size of a swap sector in bytes.
swap_fragment	number	The fragment of all objects to swap out each
			second (e.g. with a swap_fragment of 32, 1/32th
			of all objects will be swapped out each second).
static_chunk	number	The size in bytes of a static or dynamic chunk
dynamic_chunk	number	of memory.  Memory is divided into static memory
			and dynamic memory; static memory is never freed.
			Both are allocated in chunks of the specified size.
dump_file	string	The name of the state dump file.
typechecking	number	If non-zero, all LPC objects must be typechecked.
			If zero, only functions with a declared type are
			typechecked.
include_file	string	The standard include file, which is always
			included automatically for each compiled object
			(relative to the base directory).
include_dirs	string*	The standard system include directories (relative
			to the base directory).  In the first of those,
			the include files which are automatically
			generated on startup will be placed.
auto_object	string	The file name of the auto object (relative to the
			base directory).
driver_object	string	The file name of the driver object (relative to
			the base directory).
create		string	The name of the create function.
array_size	int	The maximum array and mapping size.
objects		int	The maximum number of objects.
call_outs	int	The maximum number of simultaneously active
			callouts.

   Examples of the auto object, driver object and config file are present
in the simulation of LPmud 2.4.5 for DGD, at ftp.lysator.liu.se, in
directory /pub/lpmud/drivers/dgd.
