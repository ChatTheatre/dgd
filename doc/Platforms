   To compile DGD, you will have to set HOST in src/Makefile to the
proper value:
NETBSD		NetBSD.  This is the default.
BSD386		FreeBSD or 386BSD.
GENERIC_BSD	BSD Unix.
SUNOS4		SunOS 4.x.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sun4 to src/host/Makefile.
GENERIC_SYSV	SYSV Unix.  Copy src/host/Makefile.sysv to src/host/Makefile.
LINUX		Linux.  Copy host/Makefile.sysv to host/Makefile.

   For other platforms, you can either try to use the closest of the above,
or add your own host support to the src/host.h file.  There are some systems
which I don't support directly yet, but for which porting is easy:
NeXT	use GENERIC_BSD, but in host/Makefile replace dirent.* by direct.*
Solaris	use GENERIC_SYSV, in Makefile set LIBS to -lsocket -lnsl
ULTRIX	use GENERIC_BSD
AIX	use GENERIC_SYSV, but change the definitions of UCHAR and SCHAR to
	the versions in the HOST_WITH_UNSIGNED_CHAR entry in host.h (AIX
	characters are unsigned), also add #include <sys/select.h> to
	host/unix/connect.c
Alpha	use GENERIC_SYSV, and in host.h, the GENERIC_SYSV section, change
	STRUCT_AL to 8.

   Things may become more difficult if you want to port DGD to a different
type of host.  I plan a port to MacOS myself.  If you want to do your own
port and you need some advice, contact me.
   In general, platforms must meet the following requirements:
 - shorts should be 2 bytes wide
 - integers should be either 2 or 4 bytes wide
 - longs should be at least as wide as pointers
 - all pointer types must be equally wide
 - two's complement should be used to represent negative numbers
 - the value of NULL must be 0.
For each port, one should only have to modify src/host.h, the makefiles and
the files in the src/host directory.
