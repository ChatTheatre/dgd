As of January 9th 1996, exclusive worldwide commercial rights for using DGD as
a server are held by ichat, Inc.


Motivation:

DGD has been available on the Internet since August 1993.  Before January 9th
1996, a license for a commercial MUD could be obtained for $100 per month.
Noone has ever obtained such a license.  Only one company ever tried to get
one, when it became apparent that it was already too late.

Given this lack of interest, I have decided to give an exclusive license to
ichat.  This license does not affect non-commercial use of DGD in any way.

For commercial use, a sub-license must be obtained from ichat.  For those who
are using, or want to use DGD to develop commercial products, this means that
the $100/month deal is off (or maybe not, depending on ichat).  On the other
hand, the potential market has become considerably larger.

I will continue to develop and improve DGD for both commercial and non-
commercial use.
