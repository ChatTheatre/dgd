To compile DGD on a Mac, you'll need Symantec C 7.0.4 or newer.

De-binhex dgd.proj.hqx and dgd.rsrc.hqx.  Move the project file up two
folders (into the src folder), and double-click it to start the Project
Manager.

After building the application, use a resource editor to set the SIZE
flags "accept suspend event" and "can background" to 1.

IF you want to compile DGD with CodeWarrior, you'll have to make your
own project file.  Make sure that the size of an integer is 4 bytes,
and that the symbol MACOS is #defined.
