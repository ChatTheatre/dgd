string creator(string file)

    Get the creator of a file.


string normalize_path(string file, string directory, string owner)

    Normalize a path.


int file_size(string file, int dirflag)	[System only]

    Check size of a file.  If dirflag is TRUE, recursively check size
    of directory.


void set_object_manager(object objectd)	[System only]

    Install an object manager, in which the following functions will be called
    afterwards:

    * void compile(string owner, object obj, string inherited...)

	The given object has just been compiled.  Called just before the object
	is initialized with create(0).

    * void compile_lib(string owner, string path, string inherited...)

	The given inheritable object has just been compiled.

    * void clone(string owner, object obj)

	The given object has just been cloned.  Called just before the object
	is initialized with create(1).

    * void destruct(string owner, object obj)

	The given object is about to be destructed.

    * void remove_program(string owner, string path, int timestamp, int index)

	The last reference to the given program has been removed.

    * string path_special(string compiled)

	If the standard include file contains the line `# include "AUTO"',
	this function is called so a file can be included that depends on
	what file is currently being compiled.


void set_error_manager(object errord)	[System only]

    Install an error manager, in which the following functions can be called
    afterwards:

    * void runtime_error(string error, int caught, mixed **trace)

	A runtime error has occurred.

    * void compile_error(string file, int line, string error)

	A compile-time error has occurred.


string query_error()	[System only]

    Return the last error in caught code run with infinite ticks.  This can
    be used for code like:

	catch {
	    rlimits (0; -1) {
		... do something ...
	    }
	} : error(DRIVER->query_error());

    Code run with infinite ticks should ALWAYS be run inside a catch.  This
    construct allows errors to be passed on to where they can be properly
    processed.


void message(string str)	[System only]

    Show the given string with send_message().
