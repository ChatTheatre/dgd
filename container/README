			*** EXPERIMENTAL ***

Run DGD inside a docker container, with the LPC source tree and snapshot
files outside the container.  The container is persistent and can be
updated without being stopped; DGD is configured to be hotbooted into a
new version after an update.  The JIT compiler extension, gzip extension and
crypto extension are included in the container.

The container expects the following to be present in the current directory
when started:

    server.dgd		a configuration file for DGD (see server.dgd.example)
    src			the LPC source tree
    state		where snapshots are stored

First, modify Dockerfile and set the USER argument to the ID of the user
who owns the source tree.  Then, copy your DGD config file to server.dgd;
lines marked with PLACEHOLDER in server.dgd.example will be replaced by
the container with appropriate container-relative values.

Then, copy docker-compose.yml.example to docker-compose.yml and change
the ports to match those in the configuration file.

Build and start the container with "docker-compose up".  Update the
container with "docker exec <container-id> /container/update".
