   This is release 1.0.9 of DGD.  There are no major differences with 1.0.8;
1.0.9 is essentially 1.0.8.8 + bugfixes (mostly for LPMOO).  The reason for
this release is that there are versions later than 1.0.8.8 around, which
are part of a large rewrite I at present don't have the time to finish.
Those versions are quite unstable, and hence this release, which combines
the stability of 1.0.8.8 with the bugfixes incorporated in later versions.
   I decided to let DGD stand for "Dworkin's Generic Driver" from now on.
   The next release of DGD will be 1.1.  I want to put everything in it
that has been planned for a long time, so don't expect it soon.
