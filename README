   The 2.4.5 directory contains diffs to the 2.4.5 mudlib (as it can be found
on ftp.cd.chalmers.se) to make it work with DGD.  Move the dgd subdirectory
into the mudlib directory, apply the patches, and run the program in the src
subdirectory as "a.out lpmud" (after changing the path to the mudlib directory
in the lpmud file).

   Version 1.0.a5 has the following differences with 1.0.a4, which will
require changes to be made in any code depending on them:

 - The behaviour of catch() and lock() has changed slightly.
 - get_dir() now returns an array of the form ({ names, sizes, times }),
   rather than ({ names, times, sizes }).
 - Negative indices for strings and arrays are no longer allowed.  Adding
   them was a mistake, since arr[0 .. -1], which was previously ({ }),
   became the whole array.  It is now ({ }) again.
 - Using a label with inheritance no longer specifies that a different
   kind of inheritance is to be used.  See the file Changelog for details.
