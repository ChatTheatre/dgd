   FreeBSD and Linux are now supported directly (Linux support is untested).
To compile, modify HOST in src/Makefile, and copy src/host/Makefile.yourhost
to src/host/Makefile.

   To port DGD to a new host, find out if it is closest to V7, BSD, or SysV;
add a new entry for it to the src/host.h file, which you base on MINIX68K,
BSD386 or LINUX respectively (warning: if you use MINIX68K, you probably
don't want 2-byte integers).  Also make a new src/host/Makefile.yourhost.

   The 2.4.5 simulation is now separated from the DGD distribution; it is
called sim-2.4.5.tar.gz .
