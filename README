   The 2.4.5 directory contains diffs to the 2.4.5 mudlib (as it can be found
on ftp.cd.chalmers.se) to make it work with DGD.  Move the dgd subdirectory
into the mudlib directory, apply the patches, and run the program in the src
subdirectory as "a.out lpmud" (after changing the path to the mudlib directory
in the lpmud file).
