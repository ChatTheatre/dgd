The "baseline" branch tracks changes from Hydra, only.  As such, it will
gradually be left behind by the trunk version.  Most changes from the
"baseline" branch will however be incorporated in the trunk version.

You can check out the "baseline" branch with the following command:

    svn co https://dgd-osr.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dgd-osr/branches/baseline dgd-baseline
