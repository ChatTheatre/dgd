This file was written for the closures branch of release 1.4 of DGD, 
Dworkin's Game Driver.

DGD is a rewrite from scratch of the LPMud server.  It runs on Windows, MacOS
and many versions of Unix.  The source repository for DGD can be found at:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/dgd-osr/

DGD's home page is at:

    http://dgd-osr.sourceforge.net/

This specific branch of DGD is used to develop a closures extension to DGD
It is also known as the fluffy branch. It is intended as an optional
extention to DGD to facilitate porting mudlibs developed for other drivers.

This distribution is organized as follows:

bin		Installation binaries will be created here (Unix).
doc		Documentation, still very incomplete.
mud		A place to put the mudlib.
src		Where the source of DGD resides, and where you issue your
		`make' command on Unix.
src/host/*	Subdirectories for various platform-dependent files.
tmp		The place where temporary files, such as the swap file, are
		created by DGD.

See the file doc/Platforms for help on compiling DGD on various platforms.
Also consult the src/host/*/README file for your platform, if there is one.
