This is DGD 1.0.29, an experimental version.  It is <not> the promised 1.1
release.  I release it because 1.1 will be dumpfile-compatible with 1.0.29,
and because the last official release was almost a year ago.

Many things have changed in the auto object and driver object: most notably,
lock() has been replaced by a more general scheme, and compiling of objects
from LPC files no longer happens automatically.  It is still possible, with
some adjustments, to run anything that previously ran on 1.0.9.

This release is not for the faint of heart: it is not dumpfile-compatible
with 1.0.9, some new features are only documented in the Changelog, and
the 2.4.5 simulation won't run on it out of the box.  Version 1.0.9 has
shown to be very stable; if you're running a MUD on 1.0.9 or 1.0.9.1,
upgrading may not be worth the efford at this moment.  If your MUD uses
state dumps, it may not even be possible (yet).

If, on the other hand, you are creating a new mudlib for DGD, and you have
to keep an eye on the Changelog anyhow -- you should consider upgrading
now.  The dumpfile format won't change again, and the changed feature set
offers better support for continuous MUDs.
