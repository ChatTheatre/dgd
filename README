The "baseline" branch tracks changes from Hydra, only.  As such, it will
gradually be left behind by the trunk version.  Most changes from the
"baseline" branch will however be incorporated in the trunk version.

You can add the "baseline" branch to an existing DGD git repository
with the following commands:

    git remote add -t baseline -f dworkin git://dgd-osr.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/dgd-osr/dworkin
    git branch --track baseline remotes/dworkin/baseline
