   This is release 1.0.8 of DGD.  Differences with the previous release:

 - The 'a' (meaning alpha) from the version number has been removed, and
   I decided to skip the beta stage.  DGD is stable.
 - The dump file format has been changed.  It will change again, but I
   guarantee that from now on, changes will be backward compatible.
 - A cast between string, int and float values will attempt to convert
   a string to a number and vice versa.  Important: (string) 0 now
   results in "0".
 - Some bugs were fixed and some code is better optimized.
 - My email address has changed.

   No changes are needed in the 2.4.5 simulation mudlib.

   Once again, I didn't have the time to do all the things I wanted to do,
but I decided to release this version because the dump file format is now
fixed, and because my email address changed.  The following remains to be
done for DGD:
 - A general string parsing kfun.
 - ANSI C math functions.
 - Porting the driver to more platforms, especially PC and Mac.
 - A small standard mudlib.
 - Documentation of gamedriver internals and LPC programming language.
