This file was written for release 1.4 of DGD, Dworkin's Game Driver.

DGD is a rewrite from scratch of the LPMud server.  It runs on Windows, MacOS
and many versions of Unix.  Binaries and source for the latest stable release
of DGD can be found at:

    http://ftp.dworkin.nl/dgd/

DGD's home page is at:

    http://www.dworkin.nl/dgd/

Please report bugs to <felix@dworkin.nl>.


This distribution is organized as follows:

bin		Installation binaries will be created here (Unix).
doc		Documentation, still very incomplete.
mud		A place to put the mudlib.
src		Where the source of DGD resides, and where you issue your
		`make' command on Unix.
src/host/*	Subdirectories for various platform-dependent files.
tmp		The place where temporary files, such as the swap file, are
		created by DGD.

See the file doc/Platforms for help on compiling DGD on various platforms.
Also consult the src/host/*/README file for your platform, if there is one.
